                    <p>
                       Hi, my name is Dewandra Downs (everyone calls me Dee), I have been a gymnastics coach, a flight attendant, and now I am a budding software developer. In everything that I do, my goal is to simply help people. Though the method may vary, the mission is the same. Now as I transition into the tech field, I want to build software that makes a positive and meaningful impact on those who use it. 
                       <br/>
                       At this point in my tech journey, my goal is to join a company committed to creating purposeful products. A company made up of hard-working individuals who are eager to collaborate with, learn from, and teach those around them. A company that sees more than just a CS degree when considering a potential hire. One that examines the individual as a whole, their journey, their endeavors, and their aspirations. 
                       <br/>
                       Overall, I'm aiming to get my foot in the door so I can start helping people, this time as a Software Developer. This website is just a glimpse of me as a dev, if you would like to know more, I'd love to chat.
